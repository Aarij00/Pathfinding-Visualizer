# Pathfinding Visualizer in Python

## Overview

This project is a Python application developed using Pygame that visualizes pathfinding algorithms. It demonstrates the process of finding a path between two nodes in a grid using three popular search algorithms: Depth-First Search (DFS), Breadth-First Search (BFS), and A* Search.

## Features

- **Visualization of Algorithms:** Watch how DFS, BFS, and A* Search explore the grid to find the shortest path between two nodes.
- **Interactive Interface:** Users can set start and end points, add obstacles, and select the algorithm to visualize.
- **Real-Time Pathfinding:** Observe the step-by-step process of each algorithm as it works towards finding a path.
- **Customizable Grid:** Easily modify the size and layout of the grid to test different scenarios.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
`
git clone https://github.com/Aarij00/Pathfinding-Visualizer.git && cd Pathfinding-Visualizer/
`

2. Install dependencies and run the application:
`
pip install -r requirements.txt && python main.py
`

If the above command doesn't work, try:
`
pip3 install -r requirements.txt && python3 main.py
`
## Usage

- **Set Start and End Points:** Click and drag the start and end nodes to any position on the grid.
- **Add Obstacles:** Click and drag to add obstacles on the grid that the algorithms must navigate around.
- **Select Algorithm:** Choose between Depth-First Search, Breadth-First Search, and A* Search from the provided dropdown menu.
- **Visualize Pathfinding:** Watch the selected algorithm in action as it searches for the shortest path between the start and end points
